    <h1>React Weekend!</h1>
    <p>Join the organizers of the ReactVegas meetup for a two day bootcamp on React JS. You may already know that React JS is completely transforming web app development, and native app development, and TV app development, so pretty much just, app development, but did you also know that it's super fun? So come and learn some React, for free! And eat some lunch, for free! Yourself will thank yourself.</p>
    <p>To get all of this free awesomeness, just RSVP on meetup.com so that we have an accurate headcount to purchase food for, and bring a functional, portable, computer machine. We will contact everyone that RSVPs with further information on how to be prepared for the weekend, and to reconfirm attendance, because if you RSVP and then don't attend, your food will get cold, and a kitten will die.</p>
    <p>Hope to see you there!</p>
    <p>- Fred & Andrew</p>
